# "Quote tab"
Changes your new tab page to a minimalistic page. Just a simple clock, random nature background and random quote. And the best part, it is completely open source.

## Live demo

Please visit this website to see the live demo: [https://simonrijntjes.nl/quotetab](https://simonrijntjes.nl/quotetab.html).
The quote and background also change on reload on the demo!
## Requirements

- For so far only tested on Chrome and Edge. Firefox manifest is not yet added. If you want to use it on Firefox, please use an extension that allows you to change the new tab page to a custom URL. (I recommend [this one](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/))

## Installation üë©‚Äçüíª

1. Clone this repository
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable Developer Mode and click Load unpacked extension button and upload the folder
4. Enjoy!

## Quote API
This extension uses a quote API that I created. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceSimon/QuoteAPI). You're welcome to add quotes, please read the README for more information! If you want to self host the API, you can do that too. Just follow the instructions in the README. 

## Contributing & Ways to improve üìà

In its current state, this extension does exactly what it needs to do. However, improvements can always be made!

I have tried to simplify the code so anyone can read it and start contributing at any skill level. Don't be shy :) contribute!
